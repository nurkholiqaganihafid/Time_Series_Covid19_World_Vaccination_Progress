# ðŸ“ŒTime_Series_Covid19_World_Vaccination_Progress
Analyze daily COVID-19 vaccination trends using a time series approach with the LSTM model.

Dataset: [COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress?select=country_vaccinations.csv)

## ðŸŽ¯The following are the criteria for this project:
- The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) generated by the model has good fit results.
- This dataset has 86K rows.
- Using LSTM in the model architecture
- Using a sequential model
- Using Learning Rate on Optimizer
- Implement callbacks
- MAE < 10% data scale
